**Who We Are**

We are current Graduate and Undergraduate students in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Most of us are part of the cycling community in the area as we often bike around campus. We want to encourage the use of alternative transportation like biking in the community. The aim is to increase the number of cyclists on campus by making them more informed and feel safer with our web application.

**Our Mission**

In the U.S there is a dependency in the automobile, cities have been focusing on cycling as a more sustainable alternative source of transportation by increasing the bike infrastructure such as bike lanes, bike shares, bike racks, etc. However, cycling remains still more dangerous than driving, walking, or public transit. The additional issues of bike theft, maintenance, and lack of cycling knowledge creates a barrier that leads people to avoid biking.
Our goal is to create a platform that allows cyclists to share the issues they experience when bikingâ€”whether it be a dangerous turn, poorly planned bike lane, somewhere with bike theft problems, or one of many other potential problems. The gathered crowdsourced data available to cyclists would allow them to navigate through potentially harmful situations and improve their cycling experience in Champaign-Urbana

**Who Does it Benefit?**

Daily cyclists in Champaign-Urbana benefit from this application as they can use the crowdsourced data to alter and plan their routes, so they can get to their destination with the least problems and efficiently. New cyclists who are trying to get comfortable with cycling in Champaign-Urbana can use this application to avoid situations they know they might not be able to handle.
